  '<h3>GCI 2015-2016 adventure with FOSSASIA</h3><h4>Written by PopDany</h4><p>As I said before, Fossasia has only one problem. It is not FOSSEUROPE <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-smile" title=":)">:)</span></p> <p>Fossasia is the reason why I left for a period the warmth of iOS and jumped into open source. It is the reason why today I can see my contribution on different sites, for various companies. Find them on <a href="http://fossasia.org/" target="_blank">their site</a>. Find me on this <a href="http://gci15.fossasia.org/" target="_blank">year&rsquo;s contest page</a>!</p> <p>I came to know about Code-in from a cousin which is Java dev, but from my school&rsquo;s &ldquo;hall of fame&rdquo;, too, because there were a lot of Google certificates and prizes. My older colleagues, or their t-shirts(maybe this option) made me try Google Code-In this year. Why Foss? Because they had the nicest tasks :))</p> <p>Once more, I am so proud to work with them!</p>',

  '<h3>What Open-Source Means to Me</h3><h4>Written by Gabriel</h4><h2>What Exactly is Open-Source?</h2> <p>There are various definitions of open-source out there, but Wikipedia defines open-source as &ldquo;a development model which promotes universal access via a free license to a product&rsquo;s design or blueprint, and universal distribution of that design or blueprint&rdquo;. Personally,&nbsp;I feel that open-source is somewhat like a community &ndash; a community which allows people from all walks of life, all ages, and all over the world, to come together to work together on a project.</p> <p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.youritservices.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Open-Source.jpg" alt="" width="361" height="241" /></p> <h2>How&nbsp;I Feel about Open-Source</h2> <p>Prior to my participation in Google Code-in, I had no idea of what open-source &nbsp;is&nbsp;all about. But after participating in the competition, I learnt that open-source is a meaningful platform for developers, coders, designers or the like, because it promotes collaboration &ndash; for instance, everyone and anyone can improve on the source code of a project, allowing&nbsp;the project to become much better in so many different ways.</p> <h2>Contributing to Open-Source</h2> <p>As mentioned, I find open-source extremely meaningful, and I will try to contribute to open-source whenever possible, may it be through an open-source competition (such as<a href="http://www.codein.withgoogle.com/">Google Code-in</a>), or through other means. I also feel that others should be encouraged to contribute to open-source, as one can learn many invaluable skills from the open-source community.</p> <p>Lastly, I would like to encourage all of you to visit <a href="http://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA&rsquo;s website</a>&nbsp;so that all of you&nbsp;will have a clearer idea of what open-source is all about.</p> <p><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/FOSSASIA_Logo.svg/2000px-FOSSASIA_Logo.svg.png" alt="" width="499" height="212" /></p>',

  '<h3>GraphQL For Newbs</h3><h4>Addul Hannanali</h4><h3 id="what-in-the-world-graphql-is:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">What in the world GraphQL is?</h3> <p><img src="http://abdulhannanali.github.io/my-opensource-journey/graphql-tutorial/graphql.png" alt="GraphQL Logo" />There&rsquo;s a lot of mystery behind GraphQL but it&rsquo;s not difficult to understand, what it actually is, and what it does. Because of it&rsquo;s really Sci Fi name I was sure I won&rsquo;t understand it. But after learning more about it. I was like this dog. Chilling!<img src="http://abdulhannanali.github.io/my-opensource-journey/graphql-tutorial/chilldog.gif" alt="GIF of a dog chilling" /></p> <p>GraphQL is used to build data mongering client applications in a really intuitive way. It&rsquo;s a Query Language used to request the data from the server. You send a GraphQL query to the server and it sends you the data back (exampele: JSON Payload) according to the query you sent. No need for a hundred different REST routes in order for getting complete data you want.</p> <p>GraphQL is an application query language. It makes no assumption of the protocol you are using, the query is just a plain string which you give to the GraphQL implementation.</p> <p>GraphQL is also hiearchial, which means you can accomplish much more in one query too than the rest lets you do in many queries.</p> <p>Client decides how the data needs to be structured, instead of server which lets us make it <strong>backwards compatible</strong> and at the same time upgrade for the newer version of clients.</p> <p>Data requirements probably will change with time but it doesn&rsquo;t always mean you will be allowed to change the client according to your data specs too. GraphQL allows you to make flexible queries and leaves defining the data structure to the client. This is a really helpful image I found from LearnGraphQL on how GraphQL application communicates for data<img src="http://abdulhannanali.github.io/my-opensource-journey/graphql-tutorial/graphqlflow.png" alt="GraphQL from LearnGraphQL" /></p> <p>GraphQL is strongly typed, providing you with awesome development stage compiling features which are really helpful for the debugging and let&rsquo;s you debug the queries and code before it all ships.</p> <p>You can access the GraphQL specification <a href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">here</a> and maybe create an implementation of it for the language you love.</p> <p>There&rsquo;s a great blog post on <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react">React Github Pages</a> about GraphQL <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html">here</a>. It explains many of the pros of the GraphQL and why there was a need of GraphQL in facebook internally.</p> <h3 id="querying-the-graphql:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Querying the GraphQL</h3> <p>We have hundred recipes in our Grand Cooking database. We need to retrieve the latest one with the following information hiearchy if possible:</p> <ul> <li>latestRecipe <ul> <li>id</li> <li>title</li> <li>description</li> <li>ingredients</li> <li>uploader <ul> <li>id</li> <li>dateJoined</li> <li>email</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The GraphQL query for it will look like this</p> <pre><code class="language-graphql">{ latestRecipe { _id, title, description, ingredients, uploader { _id dateJoined } } } </code></pre> <p>IMHO, the query doesn&rsquo;t look much different than what we specified in the bulleted list. Now, provided database has the data we requested and GraphQL is implemented on the back end we will get our following neat response in form of a JSON payload.</p> <pre><code class="language-json">{ "data": { "latestRecipe": { "_id": "31231", "title": "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie", "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

A simple mutation query in order to add a chef will be like this:</p> <pre><code class="language-graphql">mutation { createChef(name: "Hanan Ali", everCooked: false){ id name } } </code></pre> <p>Unlike querying you need to specify <code>mutation</code> here. After the successful creation of the query, we request the name and id to get back to us. It can&rsquo;t get any simpler.

It helps in abolishing the repetitiveness in code while requesting contents. If I know that I only want the <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> of the recipe uploader. The authorInfo contents can be rewritten as a <strong>fragment</strong> as shown below</p> <pre><code class="language-graphql">recentPost { title description author { ...authorInfo } } fragment authorInfo as Author { id name } </code></pre> <p>After defining the fragment, it&rsquo;s as simple as calling the name of the fragment in this case it is <code>...authorInfo</code></p> <p>You can learn more about the fragments <a href="https://learngraphql.com/basics/fragments">here</a></p> <h4 id="graphql-js-implementaiton:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">GraphQL.js implementaiton</h4> <p><a href="https://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> has created a reference implementation of GraphQL in JavaScript and it&rsquo;s located <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js">here</a>.

  '<h3>10 Perfect Reasons Proving Why Open Source is Good For Business</h3><h4>Written by Tejashwa Tiwari</h4><p>With the various business and government organizations that currently use open supply code like UNIX system, it&rsquo;s turning into more and more clear that worth isn&rsquo;t the sole advantage such code holds.</p> <p>Rather, free and open supply code (FOSS) holds varied alternative compelling benefits for businesses, a number of them even additional valuable than the software&rsquo;s low worth. want some examples? Let&rsquo;s begin numeration.</p> <p>1. Security</p> <p>It&rsquo;s laborious to consider a stronger testament to the superior security of open supply code than the recent discovery by Coverity of variety of defects within the automaton kernel. what is thus encouraging concerning this discovery, as I noted the opposite day, is that the sole reason it absolutely was potential is that the kernel code is hospitable public read.</p> <p>Android might not be totally open supply, however the instance continues to be an ideal illustration of what is called &ldquo;Linus&rsquo; Law,&rdquo; named for Linus Torvalds, the creator of UNIX system. consistent with that maxim, &ldquo;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs square measure shallow.&rdquo; What which means is that the additional people that will see and check a collection of code, the additional seemingly any flaws are caught and stuck quickly. It&rsquo;s primarily the polar opposite of the &ldquo;security through obscurity&rdquo; argument used thus typically to justify the employment of pricey proprietary merchandise, in alternative words.</p> <p>Does the absence of such flaw reports concerning the code of the iPhone or Windows mean that such merchandise square measure additional secure? off from it&ndash;quite the other, you would possibly even say.</p> <p>All it suggests that is that those merchandise square measure closed from public read, thus nobody outside the businesses that own them has the faintest clue what number bugs they contain. and there is no means the restricted set of developers and checkers at intervals those corporations will test their merchandise furthermore because the worldwide community perpetually scrutinizing FOSS will.</p> <p>Bugs in open supply code additionally tend to urge mounted now, as within the case of the UNIX system kernel exploit uncovered shortly agone.</p> <p>In the proprietary world? Not such a lot. Microsoft, as an example, generally takes weeks if not months to patch vulnerabilities like the recently discovered net someone zero-day flaw. smart luck to all or any the companies victimisation it within the in the meantime.</p> <p>2. Quality<br />Which is additional seemingly to be better: a code package created by a few of developers, or a code package created by thousands of developers? even as there square measure incalculable developers and users operating to boost the protection of open supply code, thus square measure there even as several innovating new options and enhancements to those merchandise</p> <p>3. Customizability</p> <p>Along similar lines, business users will take a bit of open supply code and tweak it to suit their wants. Since the code is open, it&rsquo;s merely a matter of modifying it to feature the practicality they need. do not strive that with proprietary software!</p> <p>4. Freedom</p> <p>When businesses address open supply code, they free themselves from the severe merchandiser lock-in that may afflict users of proprietary packages. Customers of such vendors square measure at the mercy of the vendor&rsquo;s vision, necessities, dictates, prices, priorities and timetable, which limits what they will do with the merchandise they are paying for.</p> <p>5. Flexibility</p> <p>When your business uses proprietary code like Microsoft Windows and workplace, you&rsquo;re on a treadmill that needs you to stay upgrading each code and hardware with no sign of ending. Open supply code, on the opposite hand, is often abundant less resource-intensive, that means that you simply will run it well even on older hardware.</p> <p>6. ability</p> <p>Open supply code is way higher at adhering to open standards than proprietary code is. If you price ability with alternative businesses, computers and users, and do not wish to be restricted by proprietary information formats, open supply code is certainly the thanks to go.</p> <p>7. Auditability</p> <p>With closed supply code, you&rsquo;ve got nothing however the vendor&rsquo;s claims telling you that they are keeping the code secure and adhering to standards, as an example. It&rsquo;s essentially a leap of religion. The visibility of the code behind open supply code, however, suggests that you&rsquo;ll see for yourself and be assured.</p> <p>8. Support choices</p> <p>Open supply code is usually free, so could be a world of support through the colourful communities encompassing each bit of code. Most each UNIX system distribution, as an example, has a web community with wonderful documentation, forums, mailing lists, forges, wikis, newsgroups and even live support chat.</p> <p>9. Cost</p> <p>Between the acquisition worth of the code itself, the usurious value of necessary virus protection, support charges, in progress upgrade expenses and therefore the prices related to being latched in, proprietary code takes additional out of your business than you almost certainly even understand.</p> <p>10. strive Before you get</p> <p>If you are considering victimisation open supply code, it&rsquo;ll generally value you nothing to do it out initial. this is often part as a result of the software&rsquo;s free worth, and part as a result of the existence of LiveCDs and Live USBs for several UNIX system distributions, as an example.</p> <p>SOURCE: PC World</p>',

  '<h3>Interview with TJ Holowaychuk</h3><h4>Addul Hannanali</h4><p><a href="https://github.com/tj">TJ Holowaychuk</a> is a really well known name in the open source world. He has done incredible contributions to the open source world and he started many notable open source projects especially in Node.js and Go world. It&rsquo;s close to impossible to use <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> or <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> and not get affected by the code he wrote or the open source projects he contributed to. TJ is an incredibly awesome person and there are hundreds of open source projects he has worked on. I came to know about TJ when I started using a very popular open source framework he created <a href="http://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a>. Afterwards, <a href="https://github.com/tj/co">Co</a>,<a href="http://koajs.com/">KoaJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tj/commander.js">CommanderJS</a> and many more awesome open source projects just kept me constantly reminding of him. He is also a really good photographer too, you can check out his photography <a href="http://tjholowaychuk.com/">here</a> and his Github profile <a href="https://github.com/tj">here</a>. TJ&rsquo;s twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/tjholowaychuk">@tjholowaychuk</a></p> <p>I emailed TJ today with the questions I wanted to ask him, he replied back in a few hours, so that&rsquo;s very kind of him, here are the questions and his reply to those questions. This was a short interview. Hope you enjoy reading it!</p> <h5 id="what-does-open-source-mean-for-you-what-is-important-about-open-source-for-you:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">What does open source mean for you? What is important about open source for you?</h5> <p>I think for me the biggest thing is <strong>learning</strong>. There&rsquo;s no way I could have learned everything that I have without open-source. Not only reading other people&rsquo;s work, but the contributions and feedback you get on your own code are really helpful. Naturally it feels great to have people enjoy something you&rsquo;ve created as well, so that can be fun.</p> <h5 id="your-open-source-contributions-and-number-of-oss-projects-are-just-astounding-what-motivates-you-to-contribute-so-much-to-the-open-source-world:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Your open source contributions and number of OSS projects are just astounding. What motivates you to contribute so much to the open source world?</h5> <p>It&rsquo;s mostly just second nature, <strong>anything that can be open source, probably should be.</strong> I find the quality of open-source is generally much higher than closed-source code, because you know everyone will be staring at it. Among other reasons the abstractions tend to be better in open-source as well since it has to be a more generic solution.</p> <h5 id="any-current-interesting-open-source-projects-you-are-working-on:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Any current interesting open source projects you are working on?</h5> <p>I&rsquo;ve just started my own company (unnamed still haha), but as a single person team I&rsquo;ve been looking more into using AWS Lambda for &ldquo;serverless&rdquo; architectures. I started <a href="https://github.com/apex">APEX</a> which is still super new but if things go well it&rsquo;ll be powering my product(s).</p> <h5 id="how-can-people-participate-more-actively-in-the-open-source-projects-you-contribute-to:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">How can people participate more actively in the open source projects you contribute to?</h5> <p>I try and document issues enough that someone could just jump in and create a pull-request for a feature if they&rsquo;re interested. <strong>If someone contributes enough, I usually just add them as a contributor to the repo</strong>. Some projects already have three or four contributors, in those cases it&rsquo;s usually not a good idea to add too many new people.</p> <h5 id="what-do-you-like-most-about-the-go-lang:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">What do you like most about the go lang?</h5> <p>Almost everything! I love that Go has strong conventions, almost all Go code looks nearly identical. It&rsquo;s fast enough for pretty much everything I do, has great tooling, built-in test framework, documentation generation, concurrency primitives, sequential code, explicit error handling, etc. Overall I think normalization is one of its strongest features, there&rsquo;s no fighting over test frameworks or conventions.</p> <h5 id="will-you-attend-the-fossasia-summit-2016-from-march-18th-to-march-20th-in-singapore-fossasia-is-an-open-source-organization-playing-a-major-role-in-promoting-open-source-software-development-in-asia-you-can-learn-more-about-it-here-https-fossasia-github-io:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Will you attend the FOSSASIA Summit 2016 from March 18th to March 20th in Singapore? FOSSASIA is an open source organization playing a major role in promoting Open Source Software Development in Asia. You can learn more about it <a href="https://fossasia.github.io/">here</a></h5> <p>Haven&rsquo;t heard of it! I rarely make it out to conferences so probably not :p</p> <hr /> <p>TJ has been actually one of the real open source aficionado for me and many others. He really believes in the open source culture and collaboration and has proved it practically. I believe and support his statement <strong>&ldquo;anything that can be open source, probably should be&rdquo;</strong>. As TJ mentions, making the code open source has many benefits, one of which is, the open source code is better in quality and more generic because of the peer reviews and contributions, so open source is a great tool for learning and being better at programming too, feedback and peer review is an important part of learning. We also wish him best of luck for his new awesome company.</p> <p>I would like to thank you for taking the time to read this article and would like to thank TJ Holowaychuk for kindly replying back to me. Here&rsquo;s an awesome picture of TJ.</p><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7QL1pzC.jpg" alt="TJ Holowaychuk Twitter Photo" /></p>',

  '<h3>What open source means to me?</h3><h4>Addul Hannanali</h4><h2 id="open-source-in-general:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Open Source in general</h2> <p>This is a topic that has really deep meaning for me cos open source means a lot of today&rsquo;s world and today&rsquo;s life would have been unimaginable without open source. For me open source is one of the evolutionary stages human beings are going through in order to make societies more collaborative, more helpful, and peaceful. It&rsquo;s the open source spirit that&rsquo;s about promoting creativity and freedom to use and create what ever we can think of in this awesome world. It&rsquo;s about <strong>not</strong> having a monopoly of a few over human intellect but to use human intellect as a resource for the well being of the world we live in. So that cats can have a life they deserve. Open source can create harmony just as the Information sharing between our body parts make us a living being. It&rsquo;s <strong>Sharing</strong> and <em>SHARING IS CARING</em>. It&rsquo;s about eliminating the culture of hostility and instead promoting harmony. 😄😄😄😄😄</p> <h3 id="open-source-in-tech:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Open Source in tech</h3> <p>This I can actually talk about and make sense. OpenSource has been prevalent since the early days from Computers. It&rsquo;s really important for innovation as a whole and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s really important for Computer Science. From Homebrew hacker club to this day computer people. Even though we have come a long way from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> which was a product of accumulation of huge open source contributions over decades and couldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the open source ideas around it&rsquo;s founders, the basic principles even today are pretty much the same.</p> <p>Today the open source means the world for me as I daily work on open source technologies on my Laptop having Open Source Operating System called <a href="https://kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu 15.10</a>, in an Open Source text editor called <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> on which I am currently typing this blog post, using Open Source run time environment called <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. I use none of the frameworks which are not open source. Even a thought of closed source web development framework seems awful to me. I can go to <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>at any moment and open the source code of the development framework, I work on, called <a href="https://expressjs.com/">ExpressJS</a> and see for my self how all this works. What a relief, Humans are innately curious and the relief that no other party is stopping me from being curious is the best relief I can get in a day 😌😌😌😌😌. The sites out there I visit are also run hugely by open source software and that makes sense too cos I can learn what they use and can effectively contribute to the security and development of those sites too. (Inspired by this paragraph I have created a Gist including the open source projects. I use, in my daily routine. You can see it <a href="https://gist.github.com/abdulhannanali/b602082bb9a778ba1080">here</a>)</p> <p>This fact also helps that I have such an awesome community including awesome people who will be there to help me whenever I raise an issue and will welcome my contributions too. Even if they don&rsquo;t accept my contributions they will tell me why they didn&rsquo;t accept it so I can actually learn and improve and resubmit my contributions.</p> <h3 id="open-source-for-education:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Open Source for education</h3> <p>I wasn&rsquo;t quite introduced to the programming world before a major open source effort, it was due to the open source projects such as <a href="https://edx.org/">edX</a> by universities like <a href="https://mit.edu/">MIT</a> and <a href="https://harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> which introduced me to this programming world. Open sourcing education has proven to have a really big impact, <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2015/ahaan-rungta-mit-opencourseware-mitx-1116">stories</a> such as these are a proof of it.</p> <h3 id="open-source-for-peace:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Open Source for Peace</h3> <p>The really fun thing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">OSS</a> world online is that it&rsquo;s the nicest place on internet too.</p> <p>People anywhere in the world can learn and grow together. This allows for mutual understanding and collaboration which is essential and can solve any issue no matter how big it is. Something governments aren&rsquo;t really good at doing. This seems like a small thing but this can start such a powerful chain reaction and can ultimately be the cause of world peace. World peace is something I would really like to have. Can we all have some more world peace?</p> <p>Governments can also open source the software they have and this is one of the reasons I like and appreciate the projects such as <a href="https://government.github.com/">government.github.com</a>. If this is done effectively it&rsquo;s a really cool thing because Governments can collaborate more effectively in improving their sectors. Really cool. Han?</p> <p>This also really inspired me to create an Open Source Project called <a href="https://damp-ridge-2114.herokuapp.com/">thepeacepledge</a>. Please sign up for this peace pledge. Your sign up matters. It&rsquo;s open source and you can see the code and maybe learn something too <a href="https://github.com/abdulhannanali/the-peace-pledge">here</a></p> <h3 id="purpose-of-writing-this:05301946b75cb988bc2be8549079b4fa">Purpose of writing this</h3> <p>This was a task assigned by <a href="https://fossasia.github.io/">FOSSASIA</a> in <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">Google CodeIn 2015</a>.

  '<h3>Open Source Interview</h3><h4>Sayan Chaudhry</h4><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>I started contributing to the FOSS world for <a href="http://sayanchaudhry.me/blog/open/source/2016/01/20/gci15.fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a> and <a href="http://sayanchaudhry.me/blog/open/source/2016/01/20/codein.withgoogle.com">Google Code-In</a>. I learnt a lot in the few weeks I spent coding, documenting and outreaching with them. Inspired, I decided to interview a few contributors to the free and open source world in order get an inssight into their motives and purposes. I interviewed <a href="https://twitter.com/namanyayg">Namanyay Goel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hackpert">Saarthak Sachdeva</a>!</p> <h2 id="talking-with-namanyay-goel">Talking With Namanyay Goel</h2> <p><img src="http://www.sayanchaudhry.me/blog/assets/nommy.jpg" alt="Namanyay Goel" /></p> <p>Hello Namanyay!

  '<h3>Learning GraphQL</h3><h4>Sayan Chaudhry</h4><h4 id="first-things-first">First Things First</h4> <p>2 days before I started writing this, I had to air about what GraphQL was. But by following <a href="http://sayanchaudhry.me/blog/graphql/2016/01/01/learngraphql">this fantastic tutorial at Learn GraphQL</a>, I have learnt all about the basics of the specification. You will need some background knowledge of NodeJS and Git before you begin!</p> <h4 id="what-is-graphql">What is GraphQL?</h4> <p>GraphQL is an application layer query language developed at Facebook. With GraphQL, you can define your backend as a well-defined graph-based schema. What? Did that go too fast? Basically, a client (someone like you) asks for data from the GraphQL server (of some website like Facebook) using queries. The server returns results in a response format specified by the client (you). Therefore the queries are known as client-specified queries.</p> <h4 id="what-you-will-need">What You Will Need?</h4> <p>You require <a href="https://sandbox.learngraphql.com/">GraphQL Sandbox</a> to interact with the GraphQL schema. GraphQL Sandbox is based on the open source GraphQL editor, GraphiQL. It has built-in support for documentation and autocompletion. It is advised to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ou8PjP3dUI4">this video</a> to familiarize yourself with the editor.</p> <p>The course at Learn GraphQL uses the schema of a typical blog app using the GraphQL sandbox.</p> <h4 id="queries-in-graphql">Queries in GraphQL</h4> <p>This is how a simple query for the blog app looks like in GraphQL.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">latestPost</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">summary</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>This returns the title and summary of the most recent post in the blog. Here is the sample output.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="ss">"data"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="ss">"latestPost"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="ss">"title"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"New Feature: Tracking Error Status with Kadira"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">"summary"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"Lot of users asked us to add a feature to set status for errors in the Kadira Error Manager. Now, we have that functionality."</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>You can use GraphQL to fetch information about all the posts of the blog. Here is how the query will look. This is also an example of nested queries, wherein the only the name of the author and only the content of the comments will be returned.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">posts</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">author</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">summary</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">comments</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">content</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>In all our example until now, we have had only one root query field. However, there can also be multiple root query fields. Here is how the code will look:</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">latestPost</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">authors</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>Lastly, queries can take arguments in parentheses.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">recentPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">count</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>Here, count is an argument for recentPosts and therefore the query will return the 5 most recent entries to the blog.</p> <h4 id="mutations-in-graphql">Mutations in GraphQL</h4> <p>We will use mutations to change our database behind GraphQL. We use the keyword mutation to begin writing our mutation. Observe this in the examples below!</p> <p>This is a simple mutation of adding the name of an author to our database.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="n">mutation</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">createAuthor</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"john"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"John Carter"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"@john"</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>This creates a new author is our database with the above mentioned details. Here is how the output looks.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="ss">"data"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="ss">"createAuthor"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="ss">"id"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"john"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"John Carter"</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>Each mutation must adhere to the required arguments and we cannot invoke our mutation without them. Doing so will result in an error.</p> <p>We can invoke multiple mutations at once making use of variables.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="n">mutation</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">sam</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">createAuthor</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"sam"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"Sam Hautom"</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"@sam"</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">chris</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">createAuthor</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"chris"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"Chris Mather"</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"@chris"</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>This mutation adds two authors named Sam and Chris to our database. It is worth noting that we cannot invoke two mutations with the same data.</p> <h4 id="fragments-in-graphql">Fragments in GraphQL</h4> <p>In GrapQL fragments are the way to group commonly used fields and reuse them.</p> <p>Have a look at this query.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">arunoda</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"arunoda"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pahan</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"pahan"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">indi</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"indi"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>You can see how we have to type the same set of fields again and again. We can use fragments to solve this problem. Here is how it works.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">arunoda</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"arunoda"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="n">authorInfo</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">pahan</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"pahan"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="n">authorInfo</span> <span class="err">}</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">indi</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">author</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="ss">"indi"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="p">...</span><span class="n">authorInfo</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="n">fragment</span> <span class="n">authorInfo</span> <span class="k">on</span> <span class="n">Author</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">twitterHandle</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>This query is exactly similar to the previous one. We just make use of fragments to avoid typing the same things over and again.</p> <h4 id="query-variables">Query variables</h4> <p>We can use variables with queries to make our lives easier while using GraphQL.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="n">query</span> <span class="n">getFewPosts</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">recentPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">count</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>In this example we have simply given a name to a query.</p> <p>Using queries with variables is very powerful. We can also change arguments while using variables.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-sql" data-lang="sql"><span class="n">query</span> <span class="n">getFewPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">postCount</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">Int</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">recentPosts</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">count</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">postCount</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="n">title</span> <span class="err">}</span> <span class="err">}</span></code></pre> </div> <p>In this example whichever number we specify while calling this query, will be the number of posts returns. Pretty cool.</p> <h4 id="setting-up-graphql-sandbox">Setting up GraphQL Sandbox</h4> <p>To start writing our own GraphQL schemas, we need to download our GraphQL Sandbox and run it locally. We will use Git to do this!</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/kadirahq/graphql-blog-schema.git</code></pre> </div> <p>This will clone the repo onto our system. Let us check out the build-schema branch, install dependancies and start the sandbox.</p> <div class="highlight"> <pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">cd </span>graphql-blog-schema git checkout build-schema npm install npm start</code></pre> </div> <p>You will be able to open the sandbox at port 3000.</p> <p><img src="http://www.sayanchaudhry.me/blog/assets/graphql.png" alt="sandbox" /></p> <h4 id="learn-more">Learn More!</h4> <p>If you have followed this tutorial, you have successfully explored the tip of the iceberg! To learn more about this amazing tool, head on over to <a href="https://learngraphql.com/basics/introduction">Learn GraphQL</a>, Follow the instructions to write your own schemas, define your own queries, mutations, executing them and using a real data source. There is lots more to learn and even more to do after you have learnt GraphQL. It is a very powerful tool and you are only bounded by your imagination!</p> <h4 id="advantages-of-graphql">Advantages of GraphQL</h4> <p>Graph QL has advantages more than one.</p> <p>Firstly, GraphQl is just a specification. It can be used with any platform and with any language. There exists a <a href="http://facebook.github.io/graphql/">Javascript implementation maintained by Facebook</a> and community maintained implementations in several languages.</p> <p>You don&rsquo;t need to change your backend for data requirement changes in client apps. This simply solves one of the biggest problems in managing REST API.</p> <p>GraphQL also allows client applications to batch and fetch data very efficiently. It allows you to gather information at once what might take multiple API calls if you are using REST.</p> <p>One thing that was missing from GraphQL was the ability to update clients reactively. There was no feature which allows you to subscribe to updates. The developer community quickly implemented event based subscriptions for the GraphQl specification.</p> <p>And obviously because GraphQL is open source! :D</p> <h4 id="experience-with-learn-graphql">Experience with Learn GraphQL</h4> <p>The tutorial over at Learn GraphQL is amazing! I was able to get from 0% to 25% knowledge of GraphQL within a few hours! I am now capable of going into more detail into application layer query languages and schemas. The explanation was to the point and each topic was explained properly. The code snippets were really helpful along with their data set! The frequent quizzes prevented me from losing interest.</p> <p>However, if I become very critical, I would say that a video based tutorial would have been even better. It is always easier to see someone do it before you and subsequently follow. But I am pretty sure the awesome code snippets made up for that.</p> <p>I loved learning GraphQL from Learn GraphQL!</p> <h4 id="footnote">Footnote</h4> <p>Written for <a href="https://gci15.fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> and <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/">Google Code-In</a>.

  '<h3>Google Code-in Experience</h3><h4>Muhammad Yasoob</h4><h1 class="entry-title">My Google Code-In Experience with FOSSASIA</h1> <p><span class="entry-meta"><time datetime="2016-01-23">January 23, 2016</time></span></p> <section> <p>Hi folks. In two days Google Code-in is going to end. Now is a good time to look back and reflect upon what I learned and achieved through this event. In this post I will try to share my experience regarding Google Code-in and especially <a href="http://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> (this is the organization which I worked with).</p> <p>This was/is my first Code-in. I didn&rsquo;t have any experience before so I was not sure what to expect. I was not aware of how this competition will turn out and what the organization/mentors&rsquo; behaviors will be. Well, I am more than happy to say that this competition fulfilled all my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it. What made it more enjoyable was the organization and mentors which I worked with!</p> <ul> <li><strong>What is the most important thing you learned in the contest?</strong></li> </ul> <p>I learned about team-work and that I am not the only talented young programmer. I learned that in order to succeed you need to do team-work. You need to take help from others and you need to delegate some of your tasks. This was the hardest lesson for me. I am not accustomed to sharing my work with anyone but this competition taught me the importance of sharing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>What was your favorite task?</strong></li> </ul> <p>There were actually a couple of them. Firstly, I loved the Django task (Making a personal website). Then there were these NodeJs (the only real dev language :P) tasks, in particular the <a href="http://yasoob.github.io/gci/post/github-nodejs-express/">GitHub OAuth task</a>. These were my favorite because they were big and required the students to spend a <em>bit-more-than-usual</em> time to complete these projects.</p> <ul> <li><strong>What could FOSSASIA mentors do in future contests to make them better?</strong></li> </ul> <p>There are quite a few things they can do. Firstly, they can make themselves available in the IRC. Currently only a few of the mentors can be seen lurking around in the IRC whereas most of the active members of the <code>#fossasia</code> IRC channel are the students. Being available on the IRC enables the students to get quick responses from the mentors.</p> <ul> <li><strong>What are your plans regarding involvement with FOSSASIA and open source in future?</strong></li> </ul> <p>I have always been an Open Source fan. As a matter of fact I even <a href="http://book.pythontips.com/">released my book</a> under CC license which is also available on <a href="https://github.com/yasoob/intermediatePython/">GitHub</a>.</p> <p>My plan is to continue my involvement with <a href="http://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> <em>and</em> Open Source development as long as I can. I will try to continue contributing to the projects of FOSSASIA and even try to become a mentor from this organization in the next GCI.</p> <hr /> <p>Through this competition I got an opportunity to make some nice friends from all over the world. In particular, I met <a href="http://yasoob.me/gci/post/codein-fossasia-experience/github.com/codethejason">Jason Wong</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yathannsh">Yathannsh Kulshrestha</a>. I was able to immediately connect/relate with both of these individuals. I hope to continue these friendships after GCI as well.

  '<h3>GitHub OAuth Authentication</h3><h4>Muhammad Yasoob</h4><p>Hi guys! In this post I will show you how you can use OAuth with GitHub. We will be using Nodejs and Express framework for accomplishing this task.</p> <p><strong>Setting up the files and installing the dependencies:</strong></p> <p>First of all, let create all the files which we will be needing for this tutorial.

Let&rsquo;s deconstruct it step by step. First of all we extract the queries from the url. This includes everything after the <code>?</code> in the url. Next we do a simple check <code>query.state == GitHubConfig.state</code> for fighting against CSRF attacks. After that we construct a payload which is just a fancy name for data sent with post request. Then we do a post request to GitHub and ask it to return us the token which we can use to make authenticated requests on behalf of the user.</p> <p>Hey! Where is this <code>authorized()</code> function coming from? Well, we haven&rsquo;t implemented it yet.

  '<h3>Sending an Email Using Django</h3><h4>Muhammad Yasoob</h4><p>Hi there folks! Recently I was doing a task for fossasia which required me to make a Django web app which allowed users to submit their email addresses and receive a welcome email in return. I was able to complete the project in a couple of hours. Most of the time was spent in making the UI look good. I am going to show you how you can easily make a similar app.</p> <p>For the sake of this tutorial we will be using Gmail.</p> <p><strong>1.Setup the project</strong></p> <p>First of all we need to start a django project. We can start one on our Desktop by typing the following command in the terminal:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>django-admin startproject gci_email </code></pre> <p>Now let&rsquo;s <code>cd</code> into the newly created project and move on:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> gci_email </code></pre> <p><strong>2.Creating a new app</strong></p> <p>Now we need to make a new app. You can do that by running the following command:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>python manage.py startapp send_email </code></pre> <p>The above command creates a <code>send_email</code> directory inside our project with a couple of files in it.</p> <p><strong>3.Modify the project settings</strong></p> <p>Now let&rsquo;s just quickly go ahead and modify the project settings a little bit. In this step we will add our app and all our email sending related info to the <code>settings.py</code> file. Open the<code>settings.py</code> file which is available in the <code>gci_email</code> folder and add the following content to it:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ini"><span class="hljs-setting">EMAIL_USE_TLS = <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-keyword">True</span></span></span> <span class="hljs-setting">EMAIL_HOST = <span class="hljs-value">"smtp.gmail.com"</span></span> <span class="hljs-setting">EMAIL_PORT = <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">587</span></span></span> <span class="hljs-setting">EMAIL_HOST_USER = <span class="hljs-value">"Your gmail email"</span></span> <span class="hljs-setting">EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = <span class="hljs-value">"Your gmail password"</span></span> <span class="hljs-setting">DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = <span class="hljs-value">"Your name"</span></span> <span class="hljs-setting">DEFAULT_TO_EMAIL = <span class="hljs-value">"Your email"</span></span> </code></pre> <p>In the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> section of your <code>settings.py</code> file you need to add the following entry to the <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> list:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-string">"send_email.apps.SendEmailConfig"</span> </code></pre> <p>Now the settings.py file should contain the following modified <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> list:</p> <pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-title">INSTALLED_APPS</span> = [ <span class="hljs-string">"send_email.apps.SendEmailConfig"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"django.contrib.admin"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"django.contrib.auth"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"django.contrib.contenttypes"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"django.contrib.sessions"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"django.contrib.messages"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"django.contrib.staticfiles"</span>, ] </code></pre> <p>Let&rsquo;s add the static files related variables to our <code>settings.py</code> file as well:</p> <pre><code class="hljs cs">BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) STATIC_ROOT = <span class="hljs-string">"staticfiles"</span> STATIC_URL = <span class="hljs-string">"/static/"</span> STATICFILES_DIRS = ( os.path.<span class="hljs-keyword">join</span>(BASE_DIR, <span class="hljs-string">"static"</span>), ) </code></pre> <p><strong>4.Creating urls</strong></p> <p>Modify the <code>urls.py</code> file in <code>gci_email</code> folder to look something like this:</p> <pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.conf.urls <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> url, include <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.contrib <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> admin urlpatterns = [ url(<span class="hljs-string">r"^admin/"</span>, admin.site.urls), url(<span class="hljs-string">r"^"</span>, include(<span class="hljs-string">"send_email.urls"</span>)), ] </code></pre> <p>Now create a <code>urls.py</code> file in <code>send_email</code> folder as well and add the following content to it:</p> <pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> django.conf.urls <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> url <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> . <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> views urlpatterns = [ url(<span class="hljs-string">r"^$"</span>, views.index, name=<span class="hljs-string">"index"</span>), url(<span class="hljs-string">r"^success"</span>, views.success, name=<span class="hljs-string">"success"</span>), ] </code></pre> <p><strong>5.Adding Views</strong></p> <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to edit the views.

  '<h3>HTML5 and JS File API</h3><h4>Muhammad Yasoob</h4><article> <section> <p>HTML5 provides us with an easy way to interface with the localfiles using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/file-upload/">File API</a>. It can be used offline as well which means that we can generate thumbnail previews without uploading the file to the server! This is just one of the benefits of this API. I am going to give you a walk-through for how you can make a small Meta-data explorer app using the File API.</p> <p>Our app will have the following features:</p> <ul> <li>Allow uploading of more than 1 file</li> <li>Display name, file-type, size and last-modified date of the selected files</li> <li>Provide us with a <code>Drop Zone</code> where we can drop the files to upload them</li> </ul> <p><strong>1.Creating the directories and files</strong></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s start off by creating our basic directory layout and files:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/Desktop $ mkdir fileapi_example $ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> fileapi_example $ mkdir css js $ touch index.html js/main.js css/main.css </code></pre> <p>The above commands will generate the following directory layout:</p> <pre><code class="hljs perl">. ├── css │&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.css ├── <span class="hljs-keyword">index</span>.html └── js └── main.js </code></pre> <p>There is just one thing missing over here.

You need to download it and place it in the <code>js</code> folder:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>cd ~<span class="hljs-regexp">/Desktop/fileapi</span>_example/js <span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>wget <span class="hljs-symbol">https:</span>/<span class="hljs-regexp">/raw.github.com/</span><span class="hljs-constant">ProgerXP</span>/<span class="hljs-constant">FileDrop</span>/master/filedrop-min.js </code></pre> <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to add some basic content to the files</p> <p><strong>2.Adding Content to <code>index.html</code></strong></p> <p>Just put the following code in <code>index.html</code> files and let me explain it a bit:</p> <pre><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-doctype">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">head</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">title</span>&gt;</span>File Metadata!<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">title</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">link</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">rel</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/css"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">href</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"css/main.css"</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">head</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"selection"</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">fieldset</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"zone"</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">legend</span>&gt;</span>Drop a file inside...<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">legend</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span>Or click here to <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">em</span>&gt;</span>Browse<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">em</span>&gt;</span>...<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">p</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">fieldset</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">output</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">id</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"list"</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span>Information<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h4</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">ul</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">class</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"main"</span>&gt;</span>No File selected<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">ul</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">output</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"js/filedrop-min.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">script</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">type</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"text/javascript"</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">src</span>=<span class="hljs-value">"js/main.js"</span> /&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">script</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">body</span>&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">html</span>&gt;</span> </code></pre> <p>There is nothing super-fancy here.

The main crux of this code lies in the <code>send</code> event handler. When a user <em>drops</em> or <em>uploads</em> a file using the upload button, <code>send</code> event is called. Next we loop over each and every file and append it&rsquo;s meta-data info to the <code>output</code> array. After that we push all of the data from the <code>output</code> array to the <code>#list</code> div. It&rsquo;s that simple!</p> <p>The last line:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash">zone.multiple(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>); </code></pre> <p>tells zone that it should allow multi-file uploads as well.</p> <p>Congrats on reaching this far! <a href="http://yasoob.me/html5-fileapi">You can see the app running here as well</a></p> </section> </article> <footer></footer>',

  '<h3>Quick guide to virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper</h3><h4>Juan F. Verhook</h4><p>Most libraries get updates on a daily basis. As they grow it becomes harder for software developers to catch up with the new documentation and a really small and diminutive change can make your apps obsolete.</p> <p>You like your apps the way they are, you don&acute;t want to change them but with or without you the software world progresses and you will have to update or get behind.</p> <p>Maybe you need to work in two projects at the same time and one uses outdated technology. Does it mean that you will have to update and downgrade the libraries every time you want to test something? Well, yes and no. You can do it, but you don&rsquo;t have to if you use a virtual environment.</p> <p><strong>virtualenv</strong> is the right tool for you. It solves the &ldquo;Project B depends on version 2.x but, Project C needs 11.2x&rdquo; dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable by creating isolated Python environments. &nbsp;Each one with its own installation directories and doesn&acute;t share libraries with the other environments you set. So you can have as many as you want, or as many as your hard drive allows you to.</p> <p>To install you just need to run in your terminal:</p> <p>sudo pip install virtualenv</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To set it up you will basically use one main command that creates a directory with all the tools you&rsquo;ll need.</p> <p>virtualenv ENV</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>It includes inside an activation script so that you can change your $PATH to the bin/ directory.</p> <p>source bin/activate</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Every command or script you run from now on will be acting for that specific env or if you prefer you can run your scripts without using active if you call them from inside your bin/ directory.</p> <p>If you want to exit the virtualenv just deactivate it with:</p> <p>deactivate</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also if you want other people to run your specific app you can list all the packages you are using in your virtualenv with:</p> <p>pip freeze &gt; <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">requirements.txt</span></p> <p>And install them with:</p> <p>pip install -r <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">requirements.tx</span>t</p> <p>If you are not very convinced about virtualenv you can use it with<strong> virtualenvwrapper,&nbsp;</strong>an extension that makes it much more easier and organized. It also places all your virtual environments in one place.</p> <p>To install just:</p> <p>pip install virtualenvwrapper</p> <p>export WORKON_HOME=~/Envs</p> <p>source /usr/local/bin/<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">virtualenvwrapper.sh</span></p> <p>You can now create virtual environments with:</p> <p>mkvirtualenv venv</p> <p>Work on a virtual environments with:</p> <p>workon venv</p> <p>Deactivate with deactivate as well but you can now delete with:</p> <p>rmvirtualenv venv</p> <p>Other useful commands<a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#other-useful-commands">&para;</a></p> <p>lsvirtualenv</p> <p>List all of the environments.</p> <p>cdvirtualenv</p> <p>Navigate into the directory of the currently activated virtual environment, so you can browse its&nbsp;site-packages, for example.</p> <p>cdsitepackages</p> <p>Like the above, but directly into&nbsp;site-packages&nbsp;directory.</p> <p>lssitepackages</p> <p>Shows contents of&nbsp;site-packages&nbsp;directory.</p>',

  '<h3>The true face of open source</h3><h4>Juan F. Verhook</h4><p>Humanity has achieved great things throughout history, among the most amazing achievements I can recall democracy, the universal declaration of human rights, languages, rail trains, the ocean voyages while the Earth was squared, DNA manipulation, space exploration and the development of GNU.</p> <p>The similarity here is that none of the above could have been achieved only by one person, it required collaboration from many individuals. That&rsquo;s precisely the point that makes open source so great. Great things are made up with smaller ones, just like a giant lego masterpiece. Block by block, commit by commit.</p> <p><img src="http://juanvulcano.github.io/images/lego.jpg" alt="alt tag" /></p> <p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter about how much you can contribute to, but the fact that each collaborator is a small ant building their anthill. It&rsquo;s all about leaving a legacy for the future generations, a legacy that will only get better and better. Open source it&rsquo;s about leaving materialism aside and focus in delivering knowledge to the future. Today I&rsquo;m really grateful, because I&rsquo;ve been learning each day a byte more with <a href="https://www.fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> , they want to see that information technology has a liberating impact on our society. They believe this can be achieved if people have access to digital tools and knowledge. Open Technologies offer free and open access. This last month they have been teaching me and hundreds of other students the impact that open source can have in our lives and the things that we can do to impact others. For that, I&rsquo;m more grateful every day and appreciate their motivation to teach.</p> <p><img src="http://juanvulcano.github.io/images/fossasia.jpg" alt="alt tag" /></p> <p>It is the same passion that most people have to go into research and academia that is shared in the minds of open source developers, the fact that you are making the world a better place, even if it&rsquo;s just a little bit. The truth is that we wouldn&rsquo;t be here, reading letters from a flat screen if millions of people wouldn&rsquo;t have collaborated to the world in they way they did.</p> <p>A strong passion is needed to develop a project, a stronger one is needed to openly develop the same project for the world. The good thing is that in open source you are never alone.</p> <p>A formal definition of open source refers to &ldquo;a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.&rdquo;</p> <p>But in reality, it is much more passionate than that.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ll make sure to openly share my passion :)</p>',

  '<h3>My Experience on IRC</h3><h4>Gabriel</h4><p>When I used IRC initially to communicate with other FOSSASIA GCI participants, I felt that it was quite intimidating as I was conversing with strangers from all over the globe. However, I realised that the IRC users were all quite friendly and helpful after interacting with them for some time. Similarly, I was a little confused on how to navigate through the various IRC channels at first, but I was able to find out more about this after Googling and learning more about IRC. Generally, it was a pleasant experience learning how to use IRC!</p> <p><img src="https://gabrielleegci.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/5508f-irc.png?w=1000" alt="" /></p> <p>I also learnt how to observe the following etiquette when using IRC:</p> <ul> <li>Be polite when conversing with others</li> <li>Do ask questions, but in a polite manner</li> <li>Do not share private information such as your home address</li> <li>Do not speak in capital letters as others may find it rude</li> <li>No swearing</li> <li>No flooding, which is sending too much information at a time</li> <li>Use colours in moderation &ndash; do not overuse them</li> </ul>',

  '<h3>Flask App with Login Functionality</h3><h4>Muhammad Yasoob</h4><p>Hi there guys! In this post I will share my experience with you while developing a Flask app with login functionality. The sourcecode of the app is available <a href="https://github.com/yasoob/flask-login">here</a>.</p> <p>We will be using the following libraries:</p> <ul> <li>Flask (obviously)</li> <li>Flask-SQLAlchemy</li> <li>Jinja2</li> <li>SQLAlchemy</li> <li>Werkzeug</li> <li>Flask-WTF</li> </ul> <p>First-of-all we will define a <strong>User</strong> model. It goes something like this:</p> <pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">User</span><span class="hljs-params">(db.Model)</span>:</span> __tablename__ = <span class="hljs-string">"user"</span> id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=<span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>) name = db.Column(db.String(<span class="hljs-number">120</span>)) password = db.Column(db.String(<span class="hljs-number">120</span>)) email = db.Column(db.String(<span class="hljs-number">240</span>)) <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">__init__</span><span class="hljs-params">(self, name, email, password)</span>:</span> self.name = name self.email = email self.set_password(password) <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">set_password</span><span class="hljs-params">(self, password)</span>:</span> self.password = generate_password_hash(password) <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">check_password</span><span class="hljs-params">(self, password)</span>:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> check_password_hash(self.password, password) <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">__repr__</span><span class="hljs-params">(self)</span>:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">"&lt;User %r&gt;"</span> % self.name </code></pre> <p>We did a couple of things here. They are:</p> <ul> <li>Assigned <code>user</code> as the tablename</li> <li>created 4 fields with <code>id</code> as the primary_key</li> <li>created 2 custom methods, <code>set_password</code> and <code>check_password</code>.</li> <li>Modified the output of <code>__repr___</code> to make it more user-friendly</li> </ul> <p>The 2 custom methods allow us to save password hashes instead of plain-text passwords. Always make sure that you save only the hashes and not the plain-text passwords so that if you database is somehow compromized, the plain-text passwords are not leaked.</p> <h2 id="views:7b492e7c49d0f5cf8978e079d93de8ff">Views:</h2> <p>There are four views in my app. Namely:</p> <ul> <li>home</li> <li>login</li> <li>signup</li> <li>logout</li> </ul> <p><strong><code>home</code>:</strong></p> <p>This route simply redirects to the <code>login</code> view if the user is not logged in. We check that the user is logged in or not by running the following code:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> session[<span class="hljs-string">"user_name"</span>]: </code></pre> <p>This only runs if there is a <code>user_name</code> key in the session dict. So if there is not<code>user_name</code> in the session dict we simply redirect the user to login by running this code:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">return</span> redirect(url_<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"login"</span>),<span class="hljs-number">401</span>) </code></pre> <p><strong>401</strong> stands for un-authorized. This status code tells the user that he is not authorized to view this page.</p> <p><strong><code>login</code>:</strong></p> <p>In this view we create an instance of the <code>LoginForm</code> and present it to the user if he is not logged in. If the user submits the form correctly and a user with the email specified exists in our server, we redirect the user to the <code>home</code> view. We check that the user_email is in the database and the password is correct by running the following code:</p> <pre><code class="hljs python">user = User.query.filter_by(email=form.email.data).first() <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> user <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">None</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> user.check_password(form.password.data): </code></pre> <p>If it is correct then we modify the session variables by running this code:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash">session[<span class="hljs-string">"user_email"</span>] = form.email.data session[<span class="hljs-string">"user_name"</span>] = user.name </code></pre> <p>If it is incorrect then we present the errors to the user and ask him/her to try again.</p> <p><strong><code>signup</code>:</strong></p> <p>This view is kind-of similar to the login view. In this view we create an instance of the<code>SignupForm</code> form and present it to the user. If the form is validated on submit then we create a user in our database with the supplied information.</p> <p>Finally, we redirect the user to the home view.</p> <p><strong><code>logout</code>:</strong></p> <p>This view simply pops the <code>user_name</code> and <code>user_email</code> values from the <code>session</code> dict.</p> <p>There is one other decorated method as well. It is <code>check_user_status</code>. It is called before every request. It allows us to modify a couple of variables to our liking. We use it to modify the <code>session</code> variable.</p> <h2 id="conclusion:7b492e7c49d0f5cf8978e079d93de8ff">Conclusion:</h2> <p>The key here is the <code>session</code> dict. We use it to check whether the user is logged-in or not. I hope you enjoyed this short intro. You can always checkout the whole source-code of the<code>app.py</code> file from the <a href="https://github.com/yasoob/flask-login/blob/master/app.py">project</a> to get a better understanding.</p>',

  '<h3>Bug Fixes for GCI Student Site</h3><h4>Jason Wong</h4><p>Yesterday, I made two pull requests for <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/fossasia/">FOSSASIA</a>. My <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/gci15.fossasia.org/pull/83">first pull request</a> fixed the issue of the icons being scattered all over the place. The icons were originally off centered from the avatar circle and off center from each other. I created a flexbox grid that automtically centered the social media icons to the center of the avatar circle. Then, I set a definte size for the a element and centered each icon vertically and horizontally inside the corresponding link elements.</p> <p><img src="http://puu.sh/m2Ri8/804ddfb4e3.jpg" alt="icons" /></p> <p>My <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/gci15.fossasia.org/pull/97">second pull request</a> aligned the Google Plus iframe so that it would stay in the center instead of being pushed to the left.

  '<h3>Extend a User Management App in Pharo</h3><h4>Jason Wong</h4><p>My task was to extend an address book located on this blog: <a href="http://magaloma.blogspot.de/2011/01/pharo-gui-with-polymorph.html">http://magaloma.blogspot.de/2011/01/pharo-gui-with-polymorph.html</a>. It featured adding, editing, and deleting a contact and only had two fields: first name and last name. I extended the applicatino by adding an email field after loading the program in Pharo 4.0.</p> <pre><code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-tag">Gofer</span> <span class="hljs-tag">it</span> <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">squeaksource</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">"Pharocasts"</span></span></span>; <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">package</span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-string">"ContactManager"</span></span></span>; <span class="hljs-tag">load</span>. </code></pre> <p><strong>First</strong>, in the contact class, I added an instance variable called email. After that, I could add methods in the <em>accessing</em> protocol that returns the email and also add the email to be printed in the printOn method in the <em>printing</em> protocol. Last, I amended <code>ContactListEditor&gt;&gt;#contacts</code> to include actually printing out the email address.</p> <p><img src="http://puu.sh/mcywp/bea6834b21.png" alt="email" /></p> <p>Smalltalk is a reflective language and was designed for constructionist learning, a method designed to reconstruct a learner&rsquo;s knowledge rather to transmit new knowledge. In my short experience using Pharo Smalltalk, I found it quite different primarily due to the enivironment it is being run in but also due to the syntax. I never coded in any language that needed to be run in its own image and found it to be quite odd. Pharo smalltalk&rsquo;s syntax also seems very different from the syntax I am used to seeing. I hope to continue doing smalltalk tasks for Google Code-in and explore smalltalk further even after GCI.</p>',

  '<h3>Using NodeJS for the First Time</h3><h4>Jason Wong</h4><p><a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> is an asyncronous event driven Javascript framework. The main feature that separates NodeJS from other systems is is its non reliance on threads and blocking code. NodeJS does not require that a certain process finishes before starting another one. This allows the application to move on instead of being stuck on long processes.</p> <p><img src="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/A87860_01/doc/appdev.817/a76975/oci02ba5.gif" alt="non blocking" /></p> <h5 id="my-opinions-on-nodejs:4d1400037a492e28b65e1117ff3d5186">My Opinions on NodeJS</h5> <p>NodeJS was a load of fun to work with, and I really did enjoy using it. Since it is based on Javascript, the learning curve for me wasn&rsquo;t that bad and I picked it up fast. It felt very familiar even though I haven&rsquo;t worked with the framework. Setup on both Windows and Linux were easy for the most part, but on Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LTS, I was confused why my Node app was not running for a while before discovering that Ubuntu&rsquo;s package manager had another package called <em>node</em> unrelated to the package <em>nodejs</em>).</p> <p>I will be honest: I did not enjoy the non-blocking feeature of NodeJS at first because it requires me to do a copious amount of callbacks. I will be trying out something different next time so I do not get code that is described on <a href="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/nodejs/callbackhell.com">this page</a>.</p> <p>Although I was very familiar with Javascript, I still felt weird using it on the server side. I am used to the idea that Javscript is a client side language designed to provide and modify visual elements. Right now I still feel a lot more comfortable with PHP for server side code, but I will try using NodeJS on my next back end application.</p> <h5 id="some-code-i-wrote:4d1400037a492e28b65e1117ff3d5186">Some Code I Wrote</h5> <p>I wrote a simple <a href="https://gist.github.com/codethejason/c2b2d71814752eb10d4d">script</a> to check for membership of a user in FOSSASIA&rsquo;s GCI Students organization on Github. This was the first NodeJS code I ever wrote, and roonyh (Aruna Herath) encouraged me to try out other tasks. I then created a <a href="https://github.com/codethejason/GithubOAuth">GitHub OAuth Application</a> which logs in the user using a GitHub OAuth token. I used <em>httpdispatcher</em> to route my application and <em>requests</em> to get data from GitHub&rsquo;s API. I spent a lot of time on the second application, but it was all worth it considering I now have a lot more knowledge about NodeJS than I had when I started out :). I will definitely be using NodeJS in the future.</p> <p><img src="http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1436439824nodejs-logo.png" alt="NODEJS" /></p>',

  '<h3>Getting Started with Hugo on Ubuntu 14.04</h3><h4>M.Yasoob Ullah Khalid</h4><p>Hugo is a static website generator which is written using golang. It is extremely fast and lightweight. You can use it to create a blog or full blown away corporate website. In this post I will show you how you can deploy a blog made with Hugo to GitHub pages. Let&rsquo;s start!</p> <p><strong>1.Download the binary</strong></p> <p>The first step is to download the Hugo binary for your platform from GitHub. I will be downloading binaries for 64bit linux as that is what I am using right now. Your system might be 32 bit so kindly keep that in mind. The download link is <a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.15/hugo_0.15_linux_amd64.tar.gz">this</a>.</p> <p><strong>2.Extract it in <code>dev</code> folder</strong></p> <p>I like to save all of my development related stuff in a separate <code>dev</code> folder in my home. You can easily create this dev folder using the following command:</p> <pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-title">mkdir</span> ~/dev </code></pre> <p>Go ahead and extract the hugo files in this folder. If you are done with this step then move on.</p> <p><strong>3.Setting up an alias</strong></p> <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to setup and alias for hugo. Currently we can call hugo from any folder by running the following command:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>~<span class="hljs-regexp">/dev/hugo</span>_<span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">15_</span>linux_amd64/hugo_<span class="hljs-number">0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">15_</span>linux_amd64 </code></pre> <p>As you can see the above command is not very user friendly. We are going to change it. Open up your <code>.bashrc</code> file using your editor of choice:</p> <pre><code class="hljs">$ nano ~/.bashrc </code></pre> <p>Add the following text at the end of this file:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">alias</span> hugo=<span class="hljs-string">"~/dev/hugo_0.15_linux_amd64/hugo_0.15_linux_amd64"</span> </code></pre> <p>After saving the file type the following command in your terminal:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">source</span> ~/.bashrc </code></pre> <p>This updates your terminal session according to your <code>.bashrc</code> file so that you don&rsquo;t have to restart the terminal for the changes to take effect.</p> <p><strong>4.Actually creating the new blog</strong></p> <p>Now hop over to your Desktop and create a new site/blog using the following commands:</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/Desktop $ hugo new site new_site $ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> new_site </code></pre> <p>The above command creates a new website in a <code>new_site</code> folder in your Desktop and<code>cd</code>s you into that folder. Now it&rsquo;s time to create a new page for our website.</p> <p><strong>5.Creating <code>about.md</code></strong></p> <p>Type the following command in your terminal to create a new <code>about.md</code> file.</p> <pre><code class="hljs coffeescript">$ hugo <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> about.md </code></pre> <p>Now you can edit the file using your editor of choice. The above file will be created inside the <code>content</code> folder. Just add valid markdown after the <code>+++</code> in the <code>about.md</code> file.</p> <p><strong>6.Create a new post</strong></p> <p>A blog is not complete with a blogpost. You can easily create one by typing the following command in your terminal:</p> <pre><code class="hljs coffeescript">hugo <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> post/first.md </code></pre> <p>Now you can edit the post in your editor of choice. The post will be created in the<code>content -&gt; post</code> folder. After you have edited the file, save it and continue with the next step.</p> <p><strong>7.Getting the themes</strong></p> <p>Currently we don&rsquo;t have any fancy themes. We can change that by cloning the <code>themes</code>repo. It can easily be done by keying in the following command in your terminal:</p> <pre><code class="hljs php">$ git <span class="hljs-keyword">clone</span> --depth <span class="hljs-number">1</span> --recursive https:<span class="hljs-comment">//github.com/spf13/hugoThemes.git themes</span> </code></pre> <p>Now you can test various themes by typing the following command:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>hugo server --theme=hyde --buildDrafts </code></pre> <p>This will generate your blog and you can view it on <code>localhost:1313</code>. Just change the &ndash;theme flag to test various themes.</p> <p>Now we are ready to actually push our blog to GitHub.</p> <p><strong>8.Building the blog</strong></p> <p>First of all we need to edit the <code>config.toml</code> file. Add the following information in it:</p> <pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-title">baseurl</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"http://yasoob.github.io/"</span> languageCode = <span class="hljs-string">"en-us"</span> title = <span class="hljs-string">"Yasoob Khalid"</span> author = <span class="hljs-string">"yasoob"</span> theme = <span class="hljs-string">"hugo-zen"</span> [params] logo = <span class="hljs-string">"/images/logo.jpg"</span> copyright = <span class="hljs-string">"Yasoob. All rights reserved."</span> twitter = <span class="hljs-string">"https://twitter.com/yasoobkhalid"</span> facebook = <span class="hljs-string">"https://www.facebook.com/m.yasoob"</span> github = <span class="hljs-string">"https://github.com/yasoob/"</span> email = <span class="hljs-string">"yasoob.khld<span class="hljs-variable">@gmail</span>.com"</span> </code></pre> <p>Replace the above variables with your own info. Now type this command:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>hugo </code></pre> <p>This will generate your blog inside a <code>public</code> directory.</p> <p><strong>9.Setup a new repo on GitHub</strong></p> <p>Make a git repository in the public folder and commit all the changes. You can easily do this:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>cd public <span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git init . <span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git add . <span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"created my awesome hugo blog"</span> </code></pre> <p>Now goto GitHub and create a new repo. We will name it <code>yasoob.github.io</code> for the sake of this tutorial. After that we will add a remote in our repository.</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git remote add origin git<span class="hljs-variable">@github</span>.<span class="hljs-symbol">com:</span>yasoob/yasoob.github.io.git <span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>git push -u origin master </code></pre> <p><strong>10.Test it out!</strong></p> <p>Now you can browse to the newly published blog. You can find it at the following url<code>&lt;github_username&gt;.github.io/</code></p> <p>Cheers!</p>',

  '<h3>An Intro to Kivy</h3><h4>M.Yasoob Ullah Khalid</h4> <p>Kivy is a fantastic application framework which allows to to make cross-platform GUI applications easily. You can even make Android and IOS applications using kivy. The<a href="http://kivy.org/#home">official website</a> of kivy sells it as &ldquo;Open source Python library for rapid development of applications that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.&rdquo;</p> <p>I have used kivy once before and I really fell in love with it. The <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/rules.html">KV</a> language gives you immense control over the GUI part of application development. You can use kivy on any OS, let it be Windows, Linux or Mac OSX. The applications created with Kivy can run on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android and iOS.</p> <p>Want to know about one more great thing about kivy? It is 100% free to use even in professional business applications. It is distributed under the MIT license which means that you don&rsquo;t have to pay a dime to use it. Some of it&rsquo;s CPU intensive parts are written in C instead of pure Python. This gives you the best of both worlds, the power of C and the ease of use of Python.</p> <p>Want to see the consiseness of Kivy? The following code constitutes a fully working kivy application:</p> <pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> kivy.app <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> App <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> kivy.uix.button <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Button <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">TestApp</span><span class="hljs-params">(App)</span>:</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">build</span><span class="hljs-params">(self)</span>:</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Button(text=<span class="hljs-string">"Hello World"</span>) TestApp().run() </code></pre> <p>Below is a sample Kivy paint app from the <a href="http://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/firstwidget.html">official tutorial</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://kivy.org/docs/_images/guide-4.jpg" alt="Kivy Paint app" /></p> <p>In the future I will love to create a Chemistry application using Kivy. The application would be similar to ChemSketch. I will use Kivy because it provides easy APIs to use Canvas and draw shapes. As that would be the main part of my app, I would love to give kivy a shot!</p> <p>I hope that you liked this short intro to kivy.</p> <p>Here are some useful links for your future endeavours:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://kivy.org/#home">Kivy Homepage</a></li> <li><a href="http://kivy.org/docs/gettingstarted/intro.html">Kivy Introduction</a></li> <li><a href="http://kivy.org/docs/tutorials/pong.html">Pong Tutorial</a></li> <li><a href="http://kivy.org/#gallery">Kivy App showcase</a></li> </ul>',

I would like to thank the admins Mario Behling, Hong Phuc Dang, and Mohit Kanwal for making this FOSSASIA&rsquo;s participation in GCI possible. I would also like to thank all the mentors for guidance and support.</p> <p><img src="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gci/fossasia.png" alt="fossasia" /></p> <h5 id="coming-into-gci:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873">Coming into GCI</h5> <p>I entered the contest right from the beginning: December 7, 2015. FOSSASIA instantly jumped out at m while browsing the list of organizations. I liked the mission of spreading free and open source software to form a better future with Open Technologies and ICT and promoting growth in science in youth. I decided to dedicate my time with FOSSASIA for the entire length of Google Code-in. I was so excited to learn new technologies and put my programming skills that I have learned before into use.</p> <p><img src="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gci/computer.jpg" alt="computers" /></p> <h5 id="projects:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873">Projects</h5> <p>My <a href="https://github.com/codethejason/gci2015">projects</a> varied widely ranging from hangman in JavaScript to a user management system in PHP Codeignitor. I tried to claim a variety of tasks but ended up mainly focusing on Javascript tasks. I had a chance to learn NodeJS and apply it to a GitHub OAuth application. My favorite application was my <a href="http://codethejason.github.io/checkers/">checkers</a> app. It is completely based on objects including the board, pieces, and tiles. This object oriented design I learned by reading <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS"><em>You Don&rsquo;t Know JS</em></a> makes it easy to understand the code and improve it. A few other people used this through GNU Licensing to accomplish their tasks (i.e. <a href="https://github.com/yasoob/checkers">yasoob</a>, <a href="https://github.com/shiftsayan/checkers">shiftsayan</a>).</p> <p>The Pharo tasks created by eMBee (Martin) were especially interesting because I learned a computer language I had never seen or heard of before in my life. The language was completely different than what I was used to seeing (for example, operators in Pharo are actually binary messages); it is probably one of the most difficult languages I have learned (difficult to find answers because of the small community). It took some time for me to get used to it, but I ended up making a lightsout game, a user management application, and a web application (which was very different from a web application I would build on PHP, NodeJS, or Python). You can see my packages <a href="http://www.smalltalkhub.com/#!/~codethejason">here</a>.</p> <p><img src="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gci/repos.png" alt="prwatch" /></p> <h5 id="contributions:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873">Contributions</h5> <p>I made many contributions during the course of GCI to Loklak-Webtweets, WhatcanIdoforFOSSASIA, and more. I built a GitHub PR Autoresponder bot to comment the preview link each time someone opened a pull request on the FOSSASIA GCI student site as shown below:</p> <p><img src="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gci/prwatch.png" alt="prwatch" /></p> <p>I did not know anything about the GitHub API or webhooks before this task; I did not know GitHub offered so many management tools to take control of the project. I have learned GitHub at my school before, but I always committed to my own repository so there were no merge conflicts or other issues to deal with. This experience gave me the taste of what open source collaboration is like with Git. I got a chance to put the objectives I learned in school into use in real world applications and to extend my knowledge of Git further.</p> <p>I also contributed to the <a href="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gciexperience/github.com/fossasia/gci15.fossasia.org">GCI Student Site</a> by replacing the twitter widget with a loklak implementation, improving the blog section dramatically, adding the loklak peers and footer section, and doing a lot of other contributions to improve the overall user experience. Special thanks to Mario Behling, Jigyasa Grover, Aruna Herath, Sudheesh Singanamalla, Manan Wason, and Rohit Kashyap for working with me on the GCI site. I implemented Loklak&rsquo;s search API on the 2015 and 2016 FOSSASIA event sites as well as on <a href="http://fossasia.org/">fossasia.org</a>. I helped others with issues on GitHub and also invited a few of my friends to join GCI with FOSSASIA (i.e. aristochaotic, scorpianz1525). I helped write tests for loklak_webclient and created issues on different repositories.</p> <p><img src="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gci/pr.jpg" alt="prwatch" /></p> <h5 id="gci-improvements-for-next-year:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873">GCI Improvements for Next Year</h5> <p>FOSSASIA did an awesome job as an organization for GCI. All the mentors were helpful and guided me towards my goals. In the beginning, it took a while for me to be added to the FOSSASIA GCI Students group, but the application that roonyh built will allow all mentors to add students to the group (<a href="https://github.com/roonyh/fossasia-gci-companion">FOSSASIA GCI Companion</a>), speeding up the process next year. I also thought the task instances could be better managed as in some cases the task was still open while it was already accomplished. More specialized varied &lsquo;learning&rsquo; tasks could be added (i.e. learning electron with NodeJS), but the variety of tasks this year was pretty decent.</p> <h5 id="future-for-myself:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873">Future for Myself</h5> <p>I learned more from this contest than I have in any classroom environment or self studying. I learned new programming practices, used services to make development more efficient, fiddled with new languages, and had a chance to utilize the concepts I learned previously. The most important thing I learned about by far is open source. Open source allows everyone to benefit from the freely available source code. It also allows the software to be more secure, flexible, and &ldquo;featureful&rdquo;, increasing the quality of the software. Let us take a look at my commit history:</p> <p><img src="http://codethejason.github.io/blog/gci/contributions.png" alt="contributions" /></p> <p>I had never been engaged in any open source project before, but after GCI I will now continue to stick with FOSSASIA and explore other projects that interest me. Knowing I can gain experience and help the world at the same time is a wonderful feeling. Anyways, I hope fellow students also enjoyed their time at GCI and will continue to contribute to open source!</p>',

  '<h3>Google Code-in 2015/16</h3><blockquote> <p>The best things in life are free&hellip;</p> </blockquote> <p>That&rsquo;s it! The very best stuff in the world is free! They&rsquo;re things we can get, we can observe, we can analyze, we can help improve and, above all, we can learn from them!</p> <p>As you probably will have noticed, I&rsquo;m not talking about you-don&rsquo;t-have-to-pay free.<br /> I&rsquo;m talking about this-belongs-to-the-humanity free, about liberty. A freedom where <strong>Open Source</strong> fits very well.</p> <p>After this brief, poetic-ish introduction, let&rsquo;s get into depth about what my first GCI has meant for me, and my opinion about it.</p> <h1 id="about-the-code-in-in-itself:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">About the Code-in in itself</h1> <p>Google is well-known for its intensive contribution in the Open Source world, and I was happy when I knew about <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/">GSoC</a> and its little brother, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/">GCI</a>.</p> <p>I think the Code-in has been <strong>very well-organised from Google&rsquo;s side</strong> (at least for the students&rsquo; part, which is the one I know). Clear rules, clear conditions, clear everything. After 10 minutes of reading you can easily become an <em>expert</em> thanks to the docs.</p> <p>You can see the incredibly good job done by Google from minute 0: just for the parental consent form, a link is provided so you can send it to your parents. There everything is explained quite good, and the process is very straight-forward.<br /> IMO, that was a brilliant idea!</p> <p>Also, you notice it&rsquo;s being organized by a tech company just by using the web app. Excluding a couple of isolated incidents, it worked really fluid and was easy to use.</p> <p>However, having an API would have been great, since it could have lead to many tasks related to it, and having extra info (such as leader boards or statistics) is always a plus.</p> <h1 id="about-my-org-fossasia:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">About my org: FOSSASIA</h1> <p>In a <a href="http://yagogg.github.io/blog/fossasia-open-technologies-in-asia/">previous post</a> I talked a bit abut <a href="http://fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> and its mission.</p> <p>I didn&rsquo;t know about it until I began the Code-in, and I&rsquo;m positively surprised of the level of development and seriousness of some of their projects. For example, <a href="https://github.com/loklak">loklak</a> is a nice idea, and offers a lot possibilities. Have I already mentioned I love APIs?</p> <p>The tasks offered by FOSSASIA were very varied, and <strong>for all kinds of profiles and tastes</strong>, which I think is very positive to encourage beginning in your comfort area, and then expand your horizons by exploring new stuff.<br /> For example, I began with some <em>vanilla</em> web tasks, and then continued discovering interesting tools like <a href="http://jshint.com/">JSHint</a> or <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.</p> <h1 id="about-the-mentors:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">About the mentors</h1> <p>Oh&hellip; the mentors&hellip;<br /> I think this is the part I liked the most of the whole event.</p> <p>Fast, hardworking, meticulous, and always ready to help. I wouldn&rsquo;t have learnt as much as I have without mentors. Ain&rsquo;t wiser voice that the experience&rsquo;s!. Their tips and tricks have been really useful throughout the GCI, and I&rsquo;ll use many of them in the future for sure.</p> <p>For example, now I know how to squash commits for pull requests, and the reasons why doing it, amongst many other things, thanks to them.</p> <p>It&rsquo;s sad they don&rsquo;t get a reward for what they do, but it&rsquo;s probably the reason why they are that good: they offer their altruistic help, just because <strong>they like what they do</strong>.</p> <h1 id="about-the-other-students:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">About the other students</h1> <p>One of the beginner tasks I took was to enter Wikimedia&rsquo;s IRC. Now I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about this decision.</p> <p>After getting a bit more familiar with IRC, I found out it&rsquo;s an awesome tool for communicating with a team, and asking for help. I really enjoyed exchanging knowledge and opinions with other students. There&rsquo;s a lot of people out there willing to help, and to be helped!</p> <h1 id="about-a-tough-decision-choosing-an-approach-to-the-contest:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">About a tough decision: choosing an approach to the contest</h1> <p>GCI&rsquo;s objective is to encourage students to participate in Open Source software development. I think the way it&rsquo;s designed is great for this purpose: now I feel much closer to the community, and want to keep actively contributing in Open Source projects.</p> <p>But the Code-in is a contest, too. It&rsquo;s all about learning, right (and that&rsquo;s been my aim all these days) but, hey! Prizes are cool too, so why not trying to get them while discovering new things and having fun?</p> <p>Here&rsquo;s where the dilemma comes: <strong>not all the tasks are balanced</strong>, and while some of them can be done in about half an hour, others require days of hard work. My personal experience says that with the latter you learn more, and are more entertaining.</p> <p>On the other hand, <strong>the criteria used for choosing the 10 finalists for each org is the amount of tasks done</strong>, so there&rsquo;s a point where you have to choose between trying to complete as many tasks as possible or working in enriching, complex ones, at the cost of noticeably having less chances to become one of the first 10.</p> <p>In my opinion, <strong>it&rsquo;s sad you have to make such a decission</strong>. A clear example is that it took me 2~3 days to complete the tasks I enjoyed the most. BTW, they were about integrating in a Node.js app <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">Git</a> (with <a href="https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit">NodeGit</a>) and GitHub&rsquo;s API. Uh, yeah, I REALLY like APIs!</p> <p>Google attempted to avoid this by adding a quality factor for choosing the Grand Prize winners. This way, only the ones with the best tasks will get the huge prize. But, before having your quality assessed, you need to be in the top 10, so it will still be a problem if you have done the best 2 tasks of the whole contest, but just 2 of them.</p> <h2 id="a-possible-solution:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">A possible solution</h2> <p>Every constructive criticism should have a suggestion to solve the problem, so here&rsquo;s mine:</p> <p>Since there are many different mentors, I understand it&rsquo;s hard for them to agree and establish a &ldquo;difficulty standard&rdquo;. Then, a good solution could be allowing them to give an amount of points per each created task. When a student submits the task, they should decide <strong>how many of that &ldquo;maximum amount of points&rdquo; does he deserve</strong>.<br /> Of course, the student should be able to ask where to improve to get the maximum punctuation.</p> <p>This way, the tasks are rewarded proportionally to the results. We (students) can learn from our mistakes, raise our quality levels, can do what we like, and <strong>still have chances to win</strong>.</p> <p>And also the mentors, who are already busy enough with their lives, don&rsquo;t have to do much more work: just giving a score to each submission. Win-win!</p> <p>The only possible inconvenient in this is that it might be a bit problematic to have a fully objective criteria. But with such a flexible and open-minded team of mentors, I don&rsquo;t think this could be a real issue. Even so, Google&rsquo;s moderation team could help settle any hypothetical disputes, as currently pointed out in the rules.</p> <h1 id="acknowledgements:e39a80f038f9a1c2dbb853890516868a">Acknowledgements</h1> <p>To <a href="https://github.com/anshuman73">anshuman73</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yasoob">yasoob</a> and the rest of GCI students. It&rsquo;s been great to talk to you, guys!</p> <p>To <a href="https://github.com/roonyh">Aruna Herath</a>, who I want to especially thank for his many explanations, and his immense dedication and patience with me ;)</p> <p>See you next year!</p>',

  '<h3>Starting with Jekyll</h3><p>This is my new blog! And I am <a href="http://sayanchaudhry.me">Sayan Chaudhry</a>. This year, I am trying my luck at <a href="http://codein.withgoogle.com">Google Code-In</a> and so far, the experience has been great. I have been exposed to the world of open source and have learn about awesome people and projects! This blog is a part of a Code-In task. We had to host a Jekyll blog or a Jekyll website using GitHub pages and, spoiler alert, this is my entry for the task, wherein I will discuss a few issues I faced.</p> <p>The biggest difficulty I faced while setting up this blog was the fact that it all seemed very new. The implementation and syntax and organization of my automatically generated blog seemed almost alien. I just could not get the functioning website onto GitHub Pages. But after hours of hitting my head and pulling my hair, I managed to pull it off. It was very difficult to even change the font and I ending up messing some other important part of the code :P. But now, as you can see, the blog is up and running just as I wanted. Next step: blogging often!</p> <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bxt4dECeBIh2VkdubXptMjR1aFE&amp;usp=sharing">Here</a> is a gallery of my development process!

  '<h3>How to setup a blog using Hugo</h3><p>It is easier than you think. Really. Just download Hugo for your system, make it easy to use (fe. on Windows you can add path to your environment variable Path).</p> <p>Then initialize your site.</p> <pre><code>hugo new site </code></pre> <p>Then download theme, like base16 (which is used on this site). Usually you will do it by git. In your site&rsquo;s root folder.</p> <pre><code>mkdir themes cd themes git clone https://github.com/htdvisser/hugo-base16-theme.git base16 </code></pre> <p>Set up Hugo by modifying site&rsquo;s config file. For example: config used on this site:</p> <pre><code>baseurl = "https://poprosturonin.github.io" languageCode = "en-us" title = "Ronin Blog" theme="base16" </code></pre> <p>It is done, but how to create some content like post? Well, we can create file manually, but Hugo can do it for us!</p> <pre><code>hugo new post/hi.md </code></pre> <p>Hugo will create empty post, so we can edit it. You can preview your site using <code>hugo server</code> or you can just build whole website by typing just <code>hugo</code></p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> built website is located in &ldquo;public&rdquo; folder</p> <p>That&rsquo;s it. Of course you can do much more, but it is a great base to do something bigger. I also found great video presenting what I presented here:</p> <div><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/w7Ft2ymGmfc" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> <h4>If you are more intrested then visit <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo website</a></h4>',

  '<h3>What Open Source Is For Me</h3><p>Humanity has achieved great things throughout history, among the most amazing achievements I can recall democracy, the universal declaration of human rights, languages, rail trains, the ocean voyages while the Earth was squared, DNA manipulation, space exploration and the development of GNU.</p> <p>The similarity here is that none of the above could have been achieved only by one person, it required collaboration from many individuals. That&rsquo;s precisely the point that makes open source so great. Great things are made up with smaller ones, just like a giant lego masterpiece. Block by block, commit by commit.</p> <p><img src="/images/lego.jpg" alt="alt tag" /></p> <p>It doesn&rsquo;t really matter about how much you can contribute to, but the fact that each collaborator is a small ant building their anthill. It&rsquo;s all about leaving a legacy for the future generations, a legacy that will only get better and better. Open source it&rsquo;s about leaving materialism aside and focus in delivering knowledge to the future. Today I&rsquo;m really grateful, because I&rsquo;ve been learning each day a byte more with <a href="https://www.fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a> , they want to see that information technology has a liberating impact on our society. They believe this can be achieved if people have access to digital tools and knowledge. Open Technologies offer free and open access. This last month they have been teaching me and hundreds of other students the impact that open source can have in our lives and the things that we can do to impact others. For that, I&rsquo;m more grateful every day and appreciate their motivation to teach.</p> <p><img src="/images/fossasia.jpg" alt="alt tag" /></p> <p>It is the same passion that most people have to go into research and academia that is shared in the minds of open source developers, the fact that you are making the world a better place, even if it&rsquo;s just a little bit. The truth is that we wouldn&rsquo;t be here, reading letters from a flat screen if millions of people wouldn&rsquo;t have collaborated to the world in they way they did.</p> <p>A strong passion is needed to develop a project, a stronger one is needed to openly develop the same project for the world. The good thing is that in open source you are never alone.</p> <p>A formal definition of open source refers to &ldquo;a program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and/or modification from its original design free of charge.&rdquo;</p> <p>But in reality, it is much more passionate than that.</p> <p>I&rsquo;ll make sure to openly share my passion :)</p> <p><img src="/images/myself.jpg" alt="alt tag" /></p> <p>Farewell</p> <p>The <a href="http://wordhtml.com/">Word to HTML converter</a> lets you convert Word documents to a clean HTML code with just a couple clicks.

  '<h3>Scraping Euro Parliament Website Using Python</h3><h4>Muhammad Yasoob</h4><p>Hi guys! I hope you are fine. In this post I will show you how you can scrape public parliament data from the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/">European Parliament</a> website. In the European Parliament Members may pose written and oral questions to the European Institutions. Our task is to extract the answers to these questions.</p> <p>We will be using Python to accomplish this task. Let&rsquo;s set up our directory and the<code>app.py</code> file.</p> <p><strong>Setting up the directories</strong></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s create a virtual environment and a new directory for holding all our python and other related files.</p> <pre><code class="hljs bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> ~/Desktop $ mkdir scrape-europarl $ <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> scrape-europarl $ mkdir data $ virtualenv env $ <span class="hljs-built_in">source</span> env/bin/activate </code></pre> <p>The <code>data</code> directory will contain all the downloaded files. Now let&rsquo;s create our <code>app.py</code>file:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>touch app.py </code></pre> <p>We should also create our <code>requirements.txt</code> file for keeping track of all the required libraries.</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>touch requirements.txt </code></pre> <p>Now open the <code>requirements.txt</code> file and add the following lines to it:</p> <pre><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-title">requests</span> lxml </code></pre> <p>Now install the requirements by running:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>pip install -r requirements.txt </code></pre> <p>We are good to go now!</p> <p><strong>Modifing the <code>app.py</code> file</strong></p> <p>First of all we need to import the required modules:</p> <pre><code class="hljs coffeescript"><span class="hljs-reserved">import</span> requests <span class="hljs-reserved">import</span> lxml.html <span class="hljs-reserved">import</span> os </code></pre> <p>Now we need a function which can be used to download <code>.pdf</code> and <code>.docx</code> files. This is a generic function which can be used in a lot of projects so you can even save it for later use:</p> <pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">download_file</span><span class="hljs-params">(file_name, url)</span>:</span> r = requests.get(url, stream=<span class="hljs-keyword">True</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> open(file_name, <span class="hljs-string">"wb"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f: <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> chunk <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> r.iter_content(chunk_size=<span class="hljs-number">1024</span>): <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> chunk: f.write(chunk) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> file_name </code></pre> <p>You need to provide this function a valid filename with a valid extension (e.g <code>.docx</code>|<code>.pdf</code>) and a valid url.</p> <p>So now we need to find the required endpoints where the data is being served on the euro parliament website. After poking around a bit I found this url:<code>http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegistreWeb/search/typedoc.htm?codeTypeDocu=QECR&amp;year=2015&amp;currentPage=</code></p> <p>You can add any <code>page number</code> at the end of the above url. This way you can enumerate all the documents on the website. After researching a bit I got to know that there are a total of <strong>1380</strong> pages. Good, now we can easily open and scrape all the pages. Below is the crux of our <code>app.py</code> file:</p> <pre><code class="hljs perl"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i in range(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1381</span>): url = <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegistreWeb/search/typedoc.htm?codeTypeDocu=QECR&amp;year=2015&amp;currentPage={0}"</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">format</span>(i) html = lxml.html.parse(url) titles = [i.strip() <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i in html.xpath(<span class="hljs-string">"//div[contains(<span class="hljs-variable">@class</span>, "notice")]/p[<span class="hljs-variable">@class</span>="title"]/a/text()"</span>)] docs = [i.strip() <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i in html.xpath(<span class="hljs-string">"//div[contains(<span class="hljs-variable">@class</span>, "notice")]/ul/li/a/<span class="hljs-variable">@href</span>"</span>)] q_refs = [i.strip() <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i in html.xpath(<span class="hljs-string">"//div[contains(<span class="hljs-variable">@class</span>, "notice")]/div[<span class="hljs-variable">@class</span>="date_reference"]/span[2]/text()"</span>)] <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> title, doc, q_ref in zip(titles, docs, q_refs): file_name = os.path.<span class="hljs-keyword">join</span>(os.getcwd(),<span class="hljs-string">"data"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"-"</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">join</span>(title.<span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"/"</span>))+<span class="hljs-string">" "</span>+q_ref+<span class="hljs-string">"."</span>+doc.<span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"."</span>)[-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]) downloaded_file = download_file(file_name, doc) <span class="hljs-keyword">print</span> downloaded_file </code></pre> <p>There is a lot going on here. Let me explain it. Firstly, we open the url using lxml. Then we again use lxml to extract all the <em>titles</em>, <em>docs</em> and <em>q_refs</em> from the html document (We use<strong>xpaths</strong> to achieve this). This returns a Python list. Next we loop over all three lists using a<code>for</code> loop and <code>zip</code> command. Next we extract the file_name from <code>q_ref</code> and pass the file_name+download link to <code>download_file</code> function. It downloads the file and returns the relative path of the downloaded file. Finally, we print the relative path of the downloaded file.</p> <p>Now you can run <code>app.py</code>:</p> <pre><code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>python app.py </code></pre> <p>Congrats! Your scraper is working. I hope you enjoyed this post. Stay tuned for new posts in near future!</p>',
  
  '<h3>A conclusion to Google Code-in 2015</h3><h4>Poh Say Keong</h4><p>Hi friends, its Say Keong here. <br /><br />I am a 14 year old from Singapore and although I am quite into tech, I am pretty new to coding and this experience has really been an eye-opener for me. Honestly, when I looking for my first task, I was pretty lost because there were just so many tasks to choose from and I was really just trying to find something manageable for me. <br /><br />My first task was to create a themed webpage using a webmaker tool called "Thimble", although it was just a beginner task, I struggled a little there as well. Shout out to Diva,saptaks,Gauthamraj and Harsh Vardhan for guiding me through the task... and yeah I had 4 mentors helping me at the same time. <br /><br />After I completed my first task, I was confident enough to set eyes on my first project that I wanted to work on. The one that interested me was the Open Event Webapp. As I am pretty new to coding I couldnt really help much, I only created two basic manifest files for Firefox OS and Chrome OS. I messed around with some AngularJS as well, but that was about it. I really hoped I could contribute more to that project, but my current coding skills really limits me. <br /><br />Then,another project surfaced on the tasks menu, I was probably the first to have worked on that project together with my mentor and I really took it as an honour. I was working on Flappy-SVG with Nicco Kunzmann. I was designing some background and character using Inkscape as a starter, and I could remember I had to redo my background twice because I duplicated my shapes instead of cloning them which increased the line count in the SVG file significantly,a lesson learnt. But overall, it was fine. <br /><br />However,since the project was still very new, there were no functions to switch the character or background. I was really passionate about the project since I could really do my part in contributing, I didnt want to give up then, so I went ahead and claimed the task. Although, I ran into many problems when I was trying to make my code work, Nicco really helped me a lot and I was able to complete that series of tasks smoothly. <br /><br />After that, I moved on to other tasks as I wanted more people to work on this project together and not just the two of us. This was my favourite project among those that I had seen and I really hope I can continue to contribute to this project in the future. <br /><br />Next, I was working on more individual tasks, like some simple Android app development, building some webapp with NodeJS and making use of databases. I did some blogs using Hugo and Jekyll as well, that was definitely and enriching experience for me. <br /><br />Soon after, the new year began and school started for me so I really wasnt able to spend as much time on GCI as I hoped to after that <br /><br />Although, I was not so interested in Loklak at first as I felt that I was unable to do most of the tasks due to my coding incompetency, eventually I decided to give it a try as it was one of the major projects people were working on. I struggled a little during the setup process but thanks to Sudheesh Singanamalla for his help, I managed to complete the setup. <br /><br />Since I was not so good with coding and due to my school work, I did not manage to contribute to the Loklak project itself, but I did went on to make some screencast videos on the setup process locally as well as the setup process with Docker, as I did with some other projects. <br /><br />As I was not so good with coding, I decided to help some of my friends to get involved instead. Some of them only managed to complete one task but some of them were enthusiastic enough to do more and get to know more about the community. <br /><br />After all that, the most important thing I learned in this contest is that anyone can contribute to the open source community regardless of how good his or her coding skills are. Hence I genuinely urge young teens to join GCI next year to really be exposed to such activities. <br /><br />I feel that the mentors really did a great job in this GCI and if there is one thing I hope can be improved on, I hope that perhaps the mentors can help in facilitating some students to work together which can help us foster new friendships as well. <br /><br />As my coding skils are not very good now, I would first work on that and every once in a while I will check back to see what FOSSASIA is up to and see how I could help. Since I am Singapore, I had already submitted my volunteer form for the FOSSASIA event here later in March and really hope that I can contribute as much as possible. <br /><br />Lastly, I really want to say thank you to all the mentors that have helped me throughout this GCI journey. Thanks!</p>',

  '<h3>How the GCI ends!</h3><h4>Sumedh Supe</h4><p>Well it’s time to say bye-bye to GCI now! There were still a lot of things to do. Things have been really good this GCI, and I really loved all what I did in it. I was working with FOSSASIA, that was my mentoring org, because of which I think I was introduced to so many new open-source projects that were stable or were in the process of development. Anyways these were really good!</p><p>I performed many tasks and seriously loved doing all. As this was my first GCI, I wasn’t much aware of stuff, but now I think that I know a lot more than I knew earlier. I learnt how to PROPERLY use stuff like Inkscape, GitHub(This was a nightmare at the beginning!), Linux-Ubuntu and Lubuntu, Cloud servers etc. The problems that I encountered were the ones that helped me the most!</p><p>I performed many tasks and the one that I loved the most was the 3D Body Visualiser. I had to report bugs in this which of course I did, but I loved using the app. I was using abnormally high values for the sizes of different parts of the body which gave me an awesome result! You can create a 3D visualization of cartoon characters with this. I loved the way it was so flexible. Why not you try it for yourself at http://www.freelayers.org ? Login, create a new measurement, fill in the details by clicking on the body parts and then Voila, you have your visualised body in 3D. This wonderful project is still in the development phase, so it is a bit slow to show up, but it is truly worth waiting for. Believe me, have a look at what I created. It is a person with fat frock like thighs called Frockighs.</p><p>I also have another favourite task of mine-The 3D Loklak crazy cow! It’s the Crazy cow in 3D. The crazy cow is the mascot of Loklak. You can find some more of my tasks on the GCI-FOSSASIA website.</p><p>This were my not so good moments of GCI- You seriously don’t know where to start, the tasks marked as beginner are more difficult than the others! Perhaps I felt this because I WAS a newbie. The tasks in GCI magically disappear. You think of doing a task but you don’t claim it due to some reasons, the next day you wake up, you look for the task on the website and it is missing! It’s magic, it’s magic! I think it was completely my mistake for all this. The only thing that I hated about the mentors was that they changed the task details just after you had submitted your task.</p><p>Anyways this could push the students to their true potential. All the mentors were really good and liked my work. I hope the other students feel the same.</p><p>I would surely miss GCI but FOSSASIA would always be there. So I am looking forward to contributing more.</p><p>Now as this ends, I will start focussing on my exams(they start in March), I didn’t study a bit all these days as I was so engrossed in my work for FOSSASIA! Wish me luck!  Eager for GCI 2016.</p>',
  
  '<h3>Using Privly for the first time</h3><h4>Yi Wen</h4>"<p><p>Hello! I will be writing about my experience of using Privly, a Google Chrome extension that allows you to post encrypted content anywhere on the internet, for the first time.</p><h3>Installing Privly</h3><p>Firstly, I went to the Chrome Web Store and searched "privly". The first search result was the extension I need. Here is a screenshot of Privly in the Chrome Web Store. <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/prib.png" alt="prib.PNG" width="1349" height="633" /> The installation took less than a minute and brought me to a Welcome page. <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/priv2.png" alt="priv2" width="1327" height="624" /></p><h3>Using Privly: Gmail</h3><p>I had a little trouble with registering for an account, since I entered my email a couple of times and got no response. However, the problem was solved when I registered through clicking "Log In" and then "Register". After setting up my account, I was ready to start using Privly!</p><h4><img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/capture31.png" alt="Capture3" width="1352" height="565" /></h4><p>I created a new message- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy fox! :)" and set the time for the message to be destroyed as 1 day. Then I copied the link and pasted it into an email to myself. The message appeared like this even though what I sent was the link: <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/capture4.png" alt="Capture4.PNG" width="887" height="189" /></p><h4>Editing content</h4><p>When I click on the link of the text, I was brought back to the Privly website which I created the message. There is an option on editing the content so I changed the ":)" to ":D" at the end of the message. <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/capture5.png" alt="Capture5" width="1348" height="604" /> True enough, my message changed when I refreshed the page of the email I sent earlier. <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/capte.png" alt="Capte" width="880" height="281" /></p><h4>How Privly appears to other people</h4><p>People cannot automatically view the content without the Privly extension, as you can see when I turn off the extension and the message turns into this link: <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/capture6.png" alt="Capture6" width="894" height="288" /> People still can view the content, however, when they click on the link which will direct them to the Privly page displaying the message.</p><h4>Destroying content</h4><p>The content I have created will be destroyed automatically 1 day later. However, I wanted to test the "Destroy Now" function.&nbsp;After clicking the "Destroy Now" button, I refreshed the page and my message was gone. Good bye message! <img src="https://yiwen2016.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/capture7.png" alt="Capture7" width="886" height="276" /></p><h3>Summary</h3><p>All in all, Privly is easy to install and use without needing much instruction. I had fun playing around with the different functions that it provides. It is a pretty good and simple extension for those who want to protect their content and privacy and giving the user control over their own content.</p><h4>References</h4><p>Privly Logo:&nbsp;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2015/privly <em>This post is created as part of a task from <a href="http://gci15.fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a> for Google Code-in 2015.
